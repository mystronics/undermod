Welcome! I'll be adding details here soon.

This mod is closed-source for now. We kindly ask users and modders to avoid copying or redistributing it without permission yet ([license](https://github.com/mystronics/undermod/tree/main?tab=License-1-ov-file)). **Do feel free to include it in your modpack!** Just please give proper credit :)

In the future, we may consider open-sourcing parts of the code, such as the Minecraft mod of even the entire procedural generation engine — but no guarantees are being made at this time. If you’re interested in this possibility, please reach out rather than attempting to modify or redistribute Undermod independently.

Thank you for your support.
